# Todo App With Drag And Drop Functions

## About

Here's a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io). While many people are creating or can create basic todo apps, this project is quite common. You might wonder, what's unique about it? Well, it's not your usual project. I initially completed this challenge when I was just starting to learn JavaScript, and it had minimal features. Now, after three months of diving deeper into JavaScript and React, I've decided to redo this challenge using React and incorporate a drag-and-drop feature to enhance its functionality.

## What I Learned from This Challenge

- Utilization of Redux Toolkit and React Redux
- Styling components with Styled Components
- Implementation of custom middleware for persisting states to localStorage
- Incorporation of small animations
- Strengthened familiarity with React, Redux, and Styled Components
