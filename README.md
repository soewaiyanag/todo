# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section

## About this project

This is the challenge from [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io).
You may ask everyone is building/ can build todo apps, this project is common. What is so special about it? No, it's different.
I already did this challenge when I started learning javascript. With minimum features. But now after 3 months of learning more javascript and react, I decided to recreate this challenge with React and add a drag and drop feature.

## What I learned from this challenge

- How to work with Redux-toolkit, React-redux
- How to style things with styled-components
- Building custom middleware for saving states to localStorage
- Building small animations
- More familiar with React, Redux && Styled-components
