# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section

## About this project

This is the challenge from [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io).
You may think everyone is building/ can build todo apps, this project is common. No, it's different.
I already done this challenge when I started learning javascript. With minimum features. But now after 3 months of learning more javascript and react, I dicided to recreate this challenge with more features like drag and drop.

## What I learned from this challenge

- How to work with Redux-toolkit, React-redux
- How to style things with styled-components
- Building small animations
- More familiar with React, Redux && Styled-components
