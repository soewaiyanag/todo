# Todo App With Drag And Drop Functions

## About

Here's a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io). While many people are creating or can create basic todo apps, this project is quite common. You might wonder, what's unique about it? Well, it's not your usual project. I initially completed this challenge when I was just starting to learn JavaScript, and it had minimal features. Now, after three months of diving deeper into JavaScript and React, I've decided to re-build this challenge using React and implemented a drag-and-drop feature to enhance its functionality.

## What I Learned from This Challenge

- Utilization of Redux Toolkit and React Redux
- Styling components with Styled Components
- Implementation of custom middleware for saving states to localStorage
- Implementation of small animations
- Strengthened familiarity with React, Redux, and Styled Components
